    - Areas that piqued my interest.
    1. Cloud engineering
    2. Salesforce development and integration
    3. Technical architect 


2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    Pursuing a career as a Salesforce Developer and eventually a Technical Architect aligns strongly with my skills, interests, and values. My foundation in Salesforce administration, AWS, and foundational HTML/CSS skills equip me for development and integration tasks, while my analytical mindset and commitment to continuous learning equip me to tackle the complex problem-solving demands of these roles. I am especially drawn to roles that emphasize hands-on implementation, structured learning, and complex technical challenges which are core to both developer and architect paths. Work environments that foster mentorship, inclusivity, and accountability, help me thrive in collaborative technical teams.
    
   To advance toward a Technical Architect role, I recognize the need to deepen my coding proficiency in Apex and Javascrpt, master Salesforce integration patterns, and gain hands-on experience with system architecture and cross-cloud solutions. Exploring real-world project work, certifications like Platform Developer II and Integration Architecture Designer, and mentorship from seasoned architects will help bridge those gaps.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - Graduating from CodeSpace with a distinction 
    - Take on more development and integration tasks at work
    - Achieving a distinction will demonstrate my mastery of core concepts and reflect my strong commitment to excellence, which will help build my credibility and confidence as I transition into more technical roles. Taking on development and integration tasks at work will give me practical, hands-on experience that directly strengthens the skills I need for Salesforce development, such as Apex coding, API integration, and system analysis. Together, these goals form a strong foundation for my growth, helping me bridge the gap between administration and advanced technical architecture.
2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - My long-term goals are to become a Salesforce Technical Architect, lead or mentor a technical team, and eventually, after about ten years, start my own Salesforce consulting company. These goals align closely with my interests and skills. I enjoy solving complex technical problems and prefer hands-on implementation, which are central to the architect role.  I value mentorship and inclusivity, so leading or supporting a technical team feels like a natural extension of my professional growth. Ultimately, starting my own consulting company would allow me to combine my technical leadership, problem-solving strengths, and entrepreneurial drive to make a broader impact in the Salesforce ecosystem.
